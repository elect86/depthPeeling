depthPeeling
============

Repository containing JOGL examples regarding the Depth Peeling technique on old (GL2) and modern (GL3) OpenGL

It requires:

- the Jglm project https://github.com/elect86/Jglm
- the java unofficial opengl SDK https://github.com/elect86/java-unofficial-opengl-SDK


`depthPeeling` package represents some earlier attempts of mine

What it is important is the `oit` one, (Order Independent Transparency).

Inside you can find the original program of Louis Bavoil and Kevin Myers, here the ["Order Independent Transparency with Dual Depth Peeling"](http://developer.download.nvidia.com/SDK/10/opengl/src/dual_depth_peeling/doc/DualDepthPeeling.pdf) paper.

original.dualDepthPeeling is the original version of Louis Bavoil

dpGl3Official is my GL3 porting
